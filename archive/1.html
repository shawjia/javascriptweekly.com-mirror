<p>Welcome to the inaugural issue of <em>JavaScript Weekly</em> - thanks for signing up! I've had great fun with <a href="http://rubyweekly.com/">Ruby Weekly</a> and wanted to branch out to a more recent programming interest of mine - <em>JavaScript</em>!</p>



<p>If there are things you want (or don't want) to see in JavaScript Weekly or if you just have suggestions, e-mail me at <code>peter@javascriptweekly.com.</code> With that, onwards..</p>
