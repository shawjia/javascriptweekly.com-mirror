<p><big><strong>This week's top news</strong></big></p>

    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://blog.jquery.com/2011/01/14/jquery-1-5-beta-1-released/">jQuery 1.5 Beta 1 Released</a></big></strong><br />John Resig has unveiled jQuery 1.5 beta 1. He invites you to try it out and see if it breaks your site (and if it does, to file a bug!). Goodies include a new $.ajax module and jQuery object 'subclassing'. Enjoy the changelog!</p>


    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://cloud9ide.posterous.com/cloud9-ide-hosted-closed-beta-starting-today">Cloud9 IDE Closed Beta Started</a></big></strong><br />Cloud9 IDE bills itself as an online 'JavaScript IDE by JavaScripters for JavaScripters' and its due for a public release in late February. It's a 'closed' beta till then but I'm told they're activating lots of accounts and they're keen for 'JavaScript lovers' to sign up.</p>

<p><big><strong>This week's top articles</strong></big></p>

    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://brendaneich.com/2011/01/harmony-of-my-dreams/">Harmony Of My Dreams</a></big></strong><br />Brendan Eich, creator of the JavaScript language, talks about an ideal future for the JavaScript language (a group of proposals and ideas he named 'Harmony') and shows off some great new syntax improvements he has in mind. A must read!</p>


    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://www.cach.me/blog/2011/01/javascript-web-workers-tutorial-parse-wiki-text-in-real-time/">Web Workers Tutorial: Parsing Wiki Text in Real Time</a></big></strong><br />Guy Halford-Thompson demonstrates how to use 'Web Workers' in order to rig up a simple Wiki text parser/previewer in the background of a Web page.

    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://www.mikechambers.com/blog/2011/01/19/getting-started-with-the-canvas-element-and-easeljs/">Getting Started with the Canvas Element and EaselJS</a></big></strong><br />Back in issue 6 I linked to EaselJS, a library that lets you work with Canvas elements in a more logical way.

Since JS supports first-class functions, once you understand these concepts, you can put them to use in your code. Ben Alman shows you how.</p>


    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://thenerdary.net/articles/entry/beautiful_element_creation_with_jquery">Beautiful Element Creation with jQuery</a></big></strong><br />A very simple but effective demo of how to more 'beautifully' create and use new DOM elements from within jQuery by Kenny Meyers.</p>
