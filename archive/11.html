<p>Welcome to issue 11 of <em>JavaScript Weekly</em>.</p>

<p><big><strong>This week's top news</strong></big></p>

    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://mir.aculo.us/2011/01/21/zepto-js-v0-4-–-jsonp-more-dom-goodness/">Zepto.js v0.4 Released – JSONP & More DOM Goodness</a></big></strong><br />Thomas Fuchs has released Zepto 0.4, a feature-driven update to his minimalistic framework for mobile WebKit browsers based on jQuery syntax. 0.4 brings JSONP AJAX requests, Blackberry detection, and more methods across the board.</p>

That was the 'beta' and this is the 'release candidate'! The difference is that more issues have been ironed out and barring any major bugs, the code in a release candidate is frequently the same as what is eventually shipped. Try it out.</p>
