<p>Issue 17 of <em>JavaScript Weekly</em> is here. As always, thanks for reading :-) (Sorry for the little delay in sending today.)</p>

<p>I've been aware that some of the links in JavaScript Weekly recently have been more browser and HTML5 related, rather than specifically about JavaScript. I also have tons of great leads on HTML5 related topics.. so I'll have an interesting announcement for those of you interested in those areas next week ;-)</p>

This should help significantly with cross-browser support. A new spec "WebCL" is now in the works to let JavaScript use OpenCL to run operations on GPUs.</p>
