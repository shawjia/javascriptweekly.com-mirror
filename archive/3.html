<p>Welcome to issue 3 of <em>JavaScript Weekly</em> - thanks for reading and a big, special thanks to everyone who's recommended the newsletter to people over the last week. It's helped a lot! Other than that, no announcements this week, straight on to the news.. </p>

They've got tons of cool books (and e-books) but, in particular, this offers lets you pick up the 'Pragmatic Guide to JavaScript' from just $7.80 (for the e-book only).

A must read, and Xmas themed too.</p>


    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://www.infoq.com/interviews/yehuda-katz-sproutcore">Yehuda Katz Discusses SproutCore [video interview]</a></big></strong><br />jQuery core team member Yehuda Katz recently left Engine Yard to join the Sprout Systems team - the team responsible for the SproutCore 'desktop-class Web application' JavaScript framework. In this interview with InfoQ, Yehuda talks about what Sproutcore is, how it works, and its future.</p>


    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://www.codediesel.com/javascript/face-detection-using-jquery/">Face Detection using jQuery</a></big></strong><br />Face-Detection is a jQuery plugin that detects human faces in images. Besides the main algorithm that does the recognition, it uses HTML5 Canvas element to grab the image data so it'll only work on browsers with Canvas support.</p>


    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://addyosmani.com/blog/jqueryuicoverflow/">How to Build a CoverFlow Effect Component with jQuery UI and CSS3</a></big></strong><br />Addy Osmani, the author of 'Essential JavaScript And jQuery Design Patterns', presents a walkthrough of building an iTunes-style 'CoverFlow' effect jQuery component using jQuery UI and CSS3.</p>

Simply, Box2D JS lets you  apply 2 dimensional physics behavior to objects on your HTML5 canvases. Tony Lukasavage shows us how.</p>


    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/">Immediately-Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)</a></big></strong><br />Ben Alman describes a common JavaScript pattern that he believes is misleadingly called a 'self executing anonymous function' and considers a new approach: the 'immediately-invoked function expression.'</p>

<p><big><strong>Interesting new libraries and tools</strong></big></p>

    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="https://github.com/chriso/node.io">node.io: Data Scraping Framework for Node.js</a></big></strong><br />node.io is a data scraping and processing framework for Node.js inspired by Google's MapReduce. It streamlines the process of parsing and filtering large amounts of data, as well as scraping data from the Web. Lots of interesting examples are included. Thanks to Jonathan Magen for recommending this.</p>


    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="https://github.com/jcoglan/canopy">Canopy: Parser Compiler for JavaScript</a></big></strong><br />Canopy is a parser compiler for JavaScript based on Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs). Essentially, it lets you create parsers for languages of your choice by providing it with a defined grammar for the language. It's heavily influenced by the popular Treetop parser toolkit for Ruby.</p>

Using these technologies? Check it out.</p>


    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://www.patrick-wied.at/static/nudejs/">nude.js: Nudity Detection in JavaScript</a></big></strong><br />In a similar vein to the 'face detection' article linked above, nude.js gives you detection of a different physical attribute: nudity. Interesting work but quite slow and still in its early stages.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070916144913/http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease67.html">Netscape and Sun Announce JavaScript: The 1995 Press Release</a></big></strong><br />Someone on Hacker News dug up an archive.org to the first press release announcing the first publicly available version of JavaScript. A blast from the past.</p>
