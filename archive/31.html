<p>Howdy Javascripterinos (not the official collective term?), welcome to issue 31 of <em>JavaScript Weekly</em>. I've launched a JavaScript podcast with Jason Seifer this week at javascriptshow.com so check that out or see the end of this issue for more.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://engineering.socialcast.com/2011/06/javascript-memory-management/">JavaScript Memory Management</a></big></strong><br />Van Miranda notes that long-standing assumptions about the life of a page are being challenged as full-page refreshes and traditional Ajax patterns are replaced with Ajax Navigation and client-side frameworks like Backbone and SproutCore. With this in mind, he looks at how you might need to think about your memory management in JavaScript a little more in future.</p>


    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2011/06/11/using-sproutcore-2-0-with-jquery-ui/">Using SproutCore 2.0 with jQuery UI</a></big></strong><br />Yehuda Katz talks about SproutCore 2.0 and how it's designed to be trivial to drop a SproutCore app into an existing page. He shows us how to do a general-purpose integration with jQuery UI.</p>

A lengthy debate pops up in the comment section.</p>


    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://www.kahusecurity.com/2011/deobfuscate-javascript-using-ms-tools/">How to De-Obfuscate Javascript Using Microsoft Tools</a></big></strong><br /></p>

This page, however, gives you a Web based version you can use for one-offs or to see what sort of output YUI Compressor gives.</p>
