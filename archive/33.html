<p>Welcome. It's July 1st, it's JavaScript Weekly, and it's issue 33.</p>
<p>In last week's issue (issue 32) there was a headline of "Brendan Eich Passes Over JavaScript 'Ownership'" which was a little misleading. In reality, Brendan Eich was passing over ownership of the SpiderMonkey module (a JavaScript implementation). The story blurb made this clear but I let an unclear headline go out so apologies to Brendan and anyone who was misled by it.</p>
