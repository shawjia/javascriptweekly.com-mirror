<p><big><strong>Headlines</strong></big></p>

    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2011/07/08/selenium-2-0/">Selenium 2.0 Released</a></big></strong><br />Selenium is a popular, cross-platform testing framework for webapps and it's hit a significant milestone with version 2.0. It's mostly written in Java but given how it's frequently used to test JavaScript, it's a release worth noting.</p>

The 'decorator' is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an existing object dynamically.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/">Essential JavaScript Design Patterns For Beginners</a></big></strong><br />I first linked to this handy single page 'book' about using design patterns in JavaScript back in issue 2 but it's been tweaked, updated, and made a fresh trip around the Javascript world over the last week so I figured it was worth including again. A good read with plenty of code.</p>

You can find and inspect instances of objects by name, type or value. An interesting idea for debugging and probing.</p>
