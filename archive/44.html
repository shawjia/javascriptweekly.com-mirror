    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://infrequently.org/2011/09/google-the-future-of-javascript/">Google and the Future of JavaScript</a></big></strong><br />Google is tipped to soon reveal a new language called Dart that it's pitching against JavaScript. In advance of this, Googler Alex Russell notes that Google 'is absolutely committed to making JavaScript better' and points to some of the wider issues involved.</p>


    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://brendaneich.com/2011/08/my-txjs-talk-twitter-remix/">Brendan Eich on ECMA TC39, JavaScript.next and Google Dash</a></big></strong><br />The creator of JavaScript talks about the future of JavaScript, how the ECMA standards committee works, and what he thinks about Google's forthcoming 'Dash' language which Google may be pitting directly against JavaScript.

    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2011/09/critics-call-foul-as-google-takes-aim-at-javascript-with-dart.ars/2">Critics call foul as Google takes aim at JavaScript with Dart</a></big></strong><br /></p>


    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://blog.izs.me/post/10213512387/javascript-is-not-web-assembly">JavaScript is Not Web Assembly</a></big></strong><br />A common theme recently has been that JavaScript is the 'x86 of the Web'. That is, JS is a common base language others can compile too and then 'run anywhere'. But Isaac Schlueter doesn't think the comparison makes sense.</p>


    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WebMatrixAndNodejsTheEasiestWayToGetStartedWithNodeOnWindows.aspx">WebMatrix and Node.js: The Easiest Way to Get Started with Node on Windows</a></big></strong><br />Scott Hanselman keeps up a great run of posts about Node.js on Windows with a look at WebMatrix, a cool little development environment for Node.js apps on Windows.</p>


    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://www.thismuchiknow.co.uk/?p=672">Why ++[[]][+[]]+[+[]] evaluates to '10' in JavaScript - Redux</a></big></strong><br />Remember "Why Does ++[[]][+[]]+[+[]] == 10 in JavaScript?" from last week. It was a popular item but JavaScript Weekly reader Tim Down found the answer to be particular accurate so he's written his own write up.</p>


    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://pointedears.de/scripts/test/es-matrix/">The ECMAScript Support Matrix</a></big></strong><br />Started in 2005 but still frequently updated, the ECMAScript 'Support Matrix' is a giant table of extended core language features in ECMAScript and JavaScript implementations along with which implementations and versions support them. (The V8 column seems a little out of date though..)</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://streamjs.org/">stream.js: A Lazy Evaluated Stream Data Structure</a></big></strong><br />Streams, as implemented with stream.js, are an easy to use data structure similar to arrays and linked lists but which are lazily evaluated so streams may, in fact, be infinite in 'length.' Lots of example code to enjoy here.</p>


    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc">TodoMVC: A Common Demo App for 7 Popular JS MVC Frameworks</a></big></strong><br />Addy Osmani presents an interesting attempt to show 7 different 'to do' apps which seem identical on the surface but that use different frameworks like SproutCore, Backbone, Sammy, Spine, and others behind the scenes.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://js2coffee.org/">JS2Coffee: Convert JavaScript Code to CoffeeScript</a></big></strong><br />JS2Coffee is like the opposite of CoffeeScript's compiler; it converts JavaScript into CoffeeScript! It's designed to help you migrate projects to CoffeeScript. We've linked it before but it's had a significant update.</p>


    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/">Stylus: An Expressive CSS Markup Language for Node.js</a></big></strong><br />Stylus is an attempt at creating another expressive language that can be converted to CSS (a la Sass). It's quite attractive and has Node.js as its focus (the compiler is written in Node.js).</p>
