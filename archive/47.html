<p>Welcome to issue 47 of <em>JavaScript Weekly</em>. Too much to show off today without any waffling here, so get to it.. :-)</p>

<p><big><strong>Headlines</strong></big></p>

    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2011/09/29/jquery-mobile-1-0rc1-released/">jQuery Mobile 1.0 Release Candidate 1 Released</a></big></strong><br />It's been a long time coming but jQuery Mobile 1.0 is almost here. With RC1, the water's warm and you can begin to use it with confidence ahead of the final release. Too much has changed in jQuery Mobile recently to sum up here so, instead, read this fine post from the team.</p>


    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://www.javascriptenlightenment.com/">JavaScript Enlightenment by Cody Lindley: A Celebrated JS E-Book</a></big></strong><br />I've seen a lot of people on Twitter raving about this book which promises to 'turn a JavaScript library user into a JavaScript developer' so I asked Cody if he could do a deal for JSW readers and he has.. a $5 discount using the code: jsweekly. I make nothing from this, by the way - just helping you out :-)</p>

<p><big><strong>Articles</strong></big></p>

    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://addyosmani.com/futureproofjs/">Future-Proofing Your JavaScript Applications for Improved Scalability</a></big></strong><br />Will Addy Osmani ever stop? Seems not, because this week he's back with a great set of slides designed to introduce us to the idea of decoupling parts of our applications into modules in order to scale them in the future.</p>


    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://www.kendoui.com/blogs/teamblog/posts/11-10-04/using_cors_with_all_modern_browsers.aspx">Using CORS with All (Modern) Browsers</a></big></strong><br />Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is a (slowly) emerging technology that gives async Web operations (think AJAX) a way to directly grab resources from different domains.</p>


    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://www.kendoui.com/blogs/teamblog/posts/11-10-06/foujui_flash_of_uninitialized_javascript_ui.aspx">FOUJUI: The 'Flash of Uninitialized JavaScript UI'</a></big></strong><br />Ever seen (or built) a page that uses so much JavaScript to render the UI that things don't look right for a while during loading? On the KendoUI blog they talk about making a 'loading screen' for these situations.</p>


    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/WebDev/UIDevelopment/Javascript/getting-started-with-javascript-unit">Getting Started with JavaScript Unit Testing (with jsTestDriver)</a></big></strong><br />Want to get started with some unit testing in JavaScript? So did Eli Weinstock-Herman and he's written up his experience in a handy 'how to' guide. It's based around jsTestDriver and a Visual Studio driven process so your mileage may vary, but it's worth a scan nonetheless.</p>
