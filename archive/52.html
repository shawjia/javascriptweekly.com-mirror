<p>Welcome to issue 52 of <em>JavaScript Weekly</em>. I just realized this marks JavaScript Weekly's first year anniversary. Many thanks for subscribing and for all of your support. The year has passed quickly (to me) and we've seen JavaScript become increasingly more important, long may this and JavaScript Weekly last :-)</p>
