<p>Welcome to issue 6 of <em>JavaScript Weekly</em> - thanks for reading. Without further ado, on to the news.</p>

<p><big><strong>This week's top news</strong></big></p>

    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2010/12/webgl-now-in-beta-here-comes-3d-web.html">WebGL Support now in Chrome Beta</a></big></strong><br />WebGL is a 3D graphics API for JavaScript - think a 3D Canvas on steroids. It's been around a while but has been tricky to enable in browsers with alpha support for it. Chrome now has it enabled by default in its latest 'beta channel' release. Check it out - Google's 'Body Browser' app is a great tech demo.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/12/10/mozilla_on_crankshaft/">Mozilla Vows To Match Google's JavaScript Performance</a></big></strong><br />Last week I linked to news about Google's 'Crankshaft' optimizations for V8. Mozilla has quickly fought back saying that they pioneered run-time type specialization and will be working hard to equal or beat the performance of V8. It's a fun time for JavaScript performance for sure.</p>
