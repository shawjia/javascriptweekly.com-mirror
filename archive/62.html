<p>Welcome to issue 62 of <em>JavaScript Weekly</em>. Nothing big to announce this week, so let's get straight on to the links :-)</p>

<p><big><strong>Headlines</strong></big></p>

    <p style="margin-left: 1.5em"><strong><big><a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/avikchaudhuri/2012/01/17/the-v8-myth-why-javascript-is-not-a-worthy-competitor/">The V8 Myth: Why JavaScript is not a Worthy Competitor</a></big></strong><br />Avik Chaudhuri, a programming language researcher at Adobe, contends that Adobe's ActionScript (as commonly used in Flash) has some significant performance advantages over JavaScript (although both are ECMAScript dialects) due to its strong typing and AOT (ahead of time) compilation optimizations. Unsurprisingly, this kicked off a debate..</p>

If you're deep into learning about Node and its future, though, it may be for you.</p>
